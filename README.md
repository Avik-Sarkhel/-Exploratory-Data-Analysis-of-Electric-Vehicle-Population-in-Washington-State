# ⚡ Exploratory Data Analysis of Electric Vehicle Trends in Washington State

This project explores electric vehicle (EV) adoption trends across Washington State using Python-based data analysis and interactive Power BI dashboards. The analysis covers both whole-dataset insights and company-specific trends for the top 5 EV makers.

## 📊 Project Highlights

- Detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)**
- Dashboard creation using **Microsoft Power BI**
- Visualized trends like:
  - Top EV-selling counties
  - EV maker-wise adoption
  - BEV vs. PHEV preferences
  - CAFV eligibility analysis
  - Urban vs. Rural distribution
  - Utility provider influence

## 🖼️ EV Brand Visuals

Custom images for 42 EV makers were generated using **DeepAI** and **Google Gemini** and are linked in the dataset. All image links are publicly hosted in this repository and dynamically integrated into the Power BI dashboard.
